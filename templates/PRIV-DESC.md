|**North&#8209;T5&#8209;NCC&#8209;modern**| The model is pretrained for an additional 200k steps on a blanaced Bokmål and Nynorsk corpus. While this was originally done for doing translation between Bokmål and Nynorsk, it might also give improved results on tasks where you know that the input/output is modern "standard" text. A significant part of the training corpus is newspapers and reports.|
|**North&#8209;T5&#8209;NCC&#8209;modern&#8209;lm**| Trained as above but with an additional 100k "language model"-pretraining.|
|**North&#8209;T5&#8209;NCC&#8209;scand**|The model is pretrained for an additional 200k steps on a Scandinavian corpus (Bokmål, Nynorsk, Danish, Swedish and Icelandic (+ a tiny bit Faeroyish)). The model was trained for increasing the understanding of what effect such training has on various languages.|
|**North&#8209;T5&#8209;scand**|Pretrained for 1,700,000 steps starting with the mT5 checkpoing. The purpose of the mode is studying the difference of different training regimes for Scandinavian language model.|
|**North&#8209;byT5&#8209;base**| This is a vocabulary free version of T5. It is trained exactly like North-T5, but instead of the 250,112 vocabulary, this model operates directly on the raw text. The model architecture might be of particulary interest for tasks involving for instance spelling correction, OCR-cleaning, handwriting recognition etc. However, it will - by design - have amuch shorter maximum sequence length.|
