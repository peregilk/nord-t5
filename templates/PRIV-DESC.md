|**North&#8209;T5&#8209;NCC&#8209;modern**| Pretrained for an additional 200k steps on a blanaced Bokmål and Nynorsk corpus. While original made for doing translation between Bokmål and Nynorsk, it might also give improved results on tasks where you know that the input/output is modern "standard" text. A significant part of the training corpus is newspapers and reports.|
|**North&#8209;T5&#8209;NCC&#8209;modern&#8209;lm**| As above but with the extra 100k language model pretraining.|
|**North&#8209;T5&#8209;NCC&#8209;scand**|Pretrained for an additional 200k steps on a corpus with the Scandinavian languages (Bokmål, Nynorsk, Danish, Swedish and Icelandic (+ a tiny bit Faeroyish)). The model was trained for increasing the understanding of what effect such training has on various languages.|
|**North&#8209;T5&#8209;scand**|Pretrained for 1,700,000 steps starting with the mT5 checkpoing. The purpose of the mode is studying the difference of different training regimes for Scandinavian language model.|
|**North&#8209;byT5&#8209;base**| A vocabulary free version of T5. Trained exactly like North-T5, but instead of the 250,112 vocabulary, this model operates directly on the raw text. The model architecture might be of particulary interest for tasks involving for instance spelling correction, OCR-cleaning, handwriting recognition etc. However, it will, by design, have a shorter maximum sequence length.|
